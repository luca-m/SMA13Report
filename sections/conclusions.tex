\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

Despite the differences analyzed in \ref{exp_results}, we can derive same conclusion about algorithm efficiency: in fact flood algorithm results to be the upper bound in term of efficacy, label and rank algorithms have both lower cost w.r.t flood but also a low delivery ratio, instead bubble algorithm presents good delivered message/cost ratio, it has comparable delivery delay with other algorithms.\\
This could indicate that this kind of simulations are a valid approach even in social based forwarding performance evaluation. Of course, as told before, further parameter refinement should be done in order to obtain more accurate measurements, and this could be valuable improvement in forwarding algorithm evaluation.\\
However the extensions developed on simulation platform (Alchemist) could also enable a new set of experimental scenarios: from social network formation to it's dynamics and maybe even the side effect on users mobility patterns. Naturally the limited amount of time available for class project are not enough for investigating the wide range of opportunities that the social network and mobility abstractions enable, so this class project could be considered as our first step into these topics.
