\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

Despite the differences analyzed in \ref{exp_results}, we can derive same conclusion about algorithm efficiency: in fact flood algorithm results to be the upper bound in term of efficacy, label and rank algorithms have both lower cost w.r.t flood and also lower efficacy, instead bubble algorithm presents good delivered message/cost ratio, it also has comparable delivery delay with other algorithms.\\
The similarity of the outcome produced by our experiment w.r.t. the original - emulation based - one, could indicate that this kind of simulations are a valid approach even in social based forwarding performance evaluation. As told before, further parameter refinement could be performed in order to better replicate original experiment scenario, but we have to remember that even considering a more congested scenario\ref{exp_results_discussion} we point out to the same conclusions about algorithms efficiency.\\
However, we can note that \emph{Alchemist}'s extensions developed during this class project could also enable a new set of experimental scenarios: from social network formation to it's dynamics, maybe even the side effect on users mobility patterns, and forwarding algorithm evaluation on arbitrary conditions too.\\
Naturally the limited amount of time available for class project are not enough for investigating the wide range of opportunities that the social network and mobility abstractions enable, so this class project could be considered as our first step into these topics.
