\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

Despite the differences analyzed in \ref{exp_results}, we can derive same conclusion about algorithm efficiency: in fact flood algorithm results to be the upper bound in term of efficacy, label and rank algorithms have both lower cost w.r.t flood but also a very low delivery ratio, instead bubble algorithm presents delivered message - cost ratio considering also that it has comparable delivery delay with other algorithms. This indicate that this kind of simulations could be a valid alternative approach even in social based forwarding performance evaluation. Also, as told before, further parameter refinement should be done in order to obtain more accurate measurements, and this could be valuable improvement.\\
However the extensions developed on simulation platform (Alchemist) could enable a new set of experimental scenarios: from social network formation to it's dynamics and maybe even the side effect on users mobility patterns. Of course, much work should be done for achieve finest results and exploring the wide range of opportunities that the social network and mobility abstractions enable.
