	abstract = {In this paper we address the engineering of complex and emerging computational systems, like those of pervasive computing applications, in which humans and devices, dipped in a very mobile environment, opportunistically interact to provide and exploit information services. To tackle the corresponding properties of situatedness, adaptivity and self-organisation, we adopt a nature-inspired agent-based meta-model in which possibly mobile, interconnected and communicating agents work according to a set of chemical-like laws. According to this view, substantiated by recent research on pervasive computing systems, we present a novel simulation framework that -- due to the chemical inspiration -- is based on a variation of existing SSAs (Stochastic Simulation Algorithms), though tailored to the specific features of our agent-based meta-model. An example application is discussed based on a crowd steering case study, in which groups of people are guided, by signs appearing on pervasive displays, towards the preferential destination and dynamically circumventing crowded regions.},
